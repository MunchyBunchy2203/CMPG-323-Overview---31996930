<h2 align="center">Branching for Project</h2>
<p align="center">Each project will make use of a Feauture Branching Strategy</p>
<dl align="center">
  <dt>Project 1: Github Familiarization</dt>
  <dd>In this project there will be no use for branching as it is only for an overview of the projects to come. Creating           branches in this project is not a requirement nor will it have an effective use.</dd><br>
  <dt>Project 2: CRUD RESTful API</dt>
  <dd>There will be a branch for each part that will in the end combine to complete Project 2. Configuration of the database,       API creation, Management Functionality and Security will each have a dedicated branch to ensure that I can start             working on one part without altering another.</dd><br>
  <dt>Project 3: Architectural Patterns</dt>
  <dd>Each critical part of the Design Pattern Implementation will have a branch to ensure easy code maintenance and reading.       Security will yet again have his own branch.</dd><br>
  <dt>Project 4: RPA, UAT and UI</dt>
  <dd>This project might only need 1 branch seeing that it is testing and UI Automation. Additional branches can be added as       needed perhaps.</dd><br>
  <dt>Project 5: COI and Power BI</dt>
  <dd>This project will a branch allocated to Report Development and Data Connection and sub-stories if neccassary.</dd><br>
